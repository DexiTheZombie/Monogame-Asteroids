# Monogame-Asteroids

## Description

This was originally a university assignment to make specific changes and alterations to an existing project we were handed, i decided to instead create my own project to deminstrate my skills and help myself learn techniques such as Shaders, Object Oriented Programming, Particle Systems (Not Implemented).

Overall i would say i learnt a great deal from doing this project. and my final grade was a ' B- '.
